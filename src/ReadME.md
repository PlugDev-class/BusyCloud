<h1>BusyCloud v0.1</h1>
<h5>This cloud isn't completed or stable. It has some bugs we have to fix.</h5>
<p>This project is being developed by PlugDev, SumoKadaver and the community via GutHub.</p>

<h2>What is BusyCloud?</h2>
<p>BusyCloud is an program, that can dynamically deploy Spigotserver oriented software. The main goal is<br>
to simplify the woirk with a Minecraft server network. Also the program has a great optional, but extensive API.<br>
It should be a solution to the most creative ideas that brighten our Minecraft world. <br>
From minigame networks, CityBuild servers to private servers with BusyCloud is the work low.<br>
<br>
BusyCloud is the next generation of Minecraft Java cloud systems. <br>
The software is currently unstable. You can use it for a productive and/or comercial network.<br>
Please report every error (exception)</p>
<br>
<h2>Do I have to pay for it?</h2>
No! Every single use of the cloud is free and unbind.<br>
We want to have a community instead of money!<br>
Donations are optional. But the use of the program is donation enough! <3<br>
<br>
<h2>Am I able to install it without any idea?</h2>
Sure! The software is easy and simple to setup.<br>
Just start the jar and let's go! The setup ask you some question<br>
and thats all!<br>
<br>
<h2>Any Rules?</h2>
Instead of other clouds, yes we have rules, but so simple, no one disturbs.<br>
Your network has to have a Free-NSFW name. <br>
If you start the program. You're directly accepting the up-to-date EULA!<br>
<br>
<h2>Is it safe?</h2>
Yes of course! It contains many checkups which you can see in the project.<br>
