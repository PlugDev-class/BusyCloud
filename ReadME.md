<h3>Important to know</h3>
<p>The current files on github are maybe unsuccessful/developerbuild. The working jar is only linked with an freaking old version of BusyCloud<p>
<p>Regardless if it's working or not, I'm very appreciating you're reading this <3</p>
<br>
<h1>~ BusyCloud v2 ~</h1>
<p>This project is being developed by "(Developer) Dennis | PlugDev", "(Content) SumoKadaver | Tristan" and the community via GutHub.</p>
<br>
<h2>What is BusyCloud?</h2>
<p>BusyCloud is an program, that can dynamically deploy Spigotserver oriented software. The main goal is<br>
to simplify the work with a Minecraft server network. Also the program has a great optional, but extensive API.<br>
It should be a solution to the most creative ideas that brighten our Minecraft world. <br>
From minigame-networks, citybuild-servers to private servers with BusyCloud is the work very low.<br>
<br>
BusyCloud is the next generation of Minecraft Java cloud systems. <br>
The software is currently unstable. You can use it for a productive and/or comercial network.<br>
Please report every error (exception) as "Issue" on my GitHub</p>
<br>
<h1>Huh v2?</h1>
<p>Yea, I rewrite the whole cloud to make the best out of the cloud! This rewrite is important to<br>
save much resources and a whole bunch of work for the end-user. Nearly every command is constructed with a low-resource-assistent<br>
But be sure, that only the v1 is published and built as jar. Huh? You want to help? Just Fork the current cloud,<br>
write something you want to add/remove etc. and pushs the update to your fork. Are you done? Then click on "contribute" and<br>
and open a pull-request! This helps a lot and saves some time. And if you want, you get some credits and marked as contributor ^^<p>
<br>
<h2>Do I have to pay for it?</h2>
No! Every single use of the cloud is free and unbind.<br>
We want to have a community instead of money!<br>
Donations are optional. But the use of the program is donation enough! <3<br>
<br>
<h2>Am I able to install it without any idea?</h2>
Sure! The software is easy and simple to setup.<br>
Just start the jar and let's go! The setup ask you some question<br>
and thats all! A very complex Introduction-command is in there as well!<br>
<br>
<h2>Any Rules?</h2>
Instead of other clouds, yes we have rules, but so simple, no one disturbs.<br>
Your network has to have a Free-NSFW name. <br>
If you start the program. You're directly accepting the up-to-date EULA!<br>
<br>
<h2>Is it safe?</h2>
Yes of course! It contains many checkups which you can see in the project.<br>
All thanks to @terrarier2111 for the nice NetListening API!<br>
