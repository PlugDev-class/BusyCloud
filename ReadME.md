<h3>Important to know</h3>
<p>The current files on github are maybe unsuccessful or in a developer-state. The working jar is only linked with an freaking old version of BusyCloud<p>
<p>Regardless if it's working or not, I'm very appreciating you're reading this <3</p>
<br>
<h1>~ BusyCloud v2 ~</h1>
<p>This project is being developed by "(Developer) Dennis | PlugDev" and the community via GutHub.</p>
<br>
<h2>What is BusyCloud?</h2>
<p>BusyCloud is an program, that can dynamically deploy Spigotserver oriented software. The main goal is<br>
to simplify the work with a Minecraft server network.<br>
It should be a solution to the most creative ideas that brighten our Minecraft world. <br>
From minigame-networks, citybuild-servers to private servers with BusyCloud is the work very low.<br>
<br>
BusyCloud is the next generation of Minecraft Java cloud systems. <br>
The software is currently unstable. You can use it for a productive and/or comercial network.<br>
Please report every error (exception) as "Issue" on my GitHub</p>
<br>
<h1>Huh v2?</h1>
<p>Yes. I rewrote this cloud a year ago, but it didn't change much. Since then this cloud wasn't working either way.<br>
But anyway, it was fun ^^. Nearly every command is constructed with a low-resource-assistent.<br>
But be sure, that only the v1 is published and built as a jar. Huh? You want to help? Just Fork the current cloud,<br>
write something you want to add/remove and push the update to your fork. Are you done? Then click on "contribute" and<br>
and open a pull-request! This helps a lot and saves some time. And if you want, you get some credits hehe<p>
<br>
<h2>Am I able to install it without any idea with programming?</h2>
Yes and no.. As long this version is packed as jar, it's very easy to install it.<br>
Just start the jar and let's go! The setup-assistant ask you some questions<br>
and that's all! A very complex introduction-command is in there as well if you want to setup every single property!<br>
<br>
<h2>Any Rules?</h2>
Just a single rule..<br>
Your network has to have a family-friendly name.<br>
If you start the program. You're directly accepting the EULA!<br>
<br>
<h2>Is it safe?</h2>
Probably..? If you don't trust any jars with an unencrypted open-source on github, you should probably think about yourself..
<br>
